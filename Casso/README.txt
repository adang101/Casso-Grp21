HOW TO RUN:
 * In the terminal, make sure that you have changed directories into "Casso"
      * Your file path should look like C:\user\pathTo\GitHubDirectory
      * You would then enter "cd Casso" into your terminal
      * Your file path should then look like C:\user\pathTo\GitHubDirectory\Casso
 * From here, you need to activate the virtual environment to ensure all dependencies are loaded
      * To do that enter "./venv/bin/activate" on Windows
      * On MacOS enter "source ./venv/bin/activate"
 * Your path should now look like: (venv) C:\user\pathTo\GitHubDirectory\Casso
      * (venv) means you have correctly activated the environment!

 * From there, enter "python.exe run.py"
      * Click on the development server web link. It should look like:
            "Running on http://127.0.0.1:****"
      * To exit enter "CTRL + C" into the terminal
